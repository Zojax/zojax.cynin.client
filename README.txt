WELCOME TO CYN.IN DESKTOP
-----------------------------------------
The cyn.in desktop is based and made upon the Adobe Integrated Runtime (AIR) platform. A 
good to decent knowledge of the runtime, Flex and ActionScript 3.0 is required to build
and develop the cyn.in desktop client.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
A Flex IDE - FlexBuilder is recommended.
The latest Adobe AIR SDK and Flex SDK: We're currently isng AIR 1.5 and Flex 3.2. The 
corresponding version of Flexbuilder for this is 3.0.2.

DEVELOPING
---------------------------
Load up the project in your Flex IDE and build it as normal. Running the client in
debug mode requires a cyn.in server (just like the normal operation of the desktop
client does) and we recommend running a buildout of the source version of cyn.in in
"fg" (foreground) mode.

The cyn.in desktop communicates with the cyn.in server using the XMLRPC protocol, most
of the requisite server-side stuff for this is in the product called ubify.xmlrpc, you 
will find this in the latest (v2.1) snapshot of the cyn.in server's source code.

NEXT STEPS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
----------------------------
We're actively looking for contributions in the entire cyn.in project and would love to
hear from you if you are interested in helping out with any of the following:

Development: Experienced Flex developers with thorough (and we mean you dream in vector
transformed pixels) experience in AIR are more than welcome. Mail us at 
devel@cynapse.com with some references to past work and what you'd like to help 
out with.

Testing: Any desktop application can have more cases than any testing team can handle. If
you love putting software through it's paces, and showing where it's bad or could be improved
we have much need of you as well. Mail us at devel@cynapse.com.

Sponsorships and Feature acceleration: The feature you're probaly looking to do yourself 
is probably already on our roadmap anyway. You could think of accelerating the development 
by sponsoring it. Drop in a mail to devel@cynapse.com with what you need and we'll see
what can be done.
